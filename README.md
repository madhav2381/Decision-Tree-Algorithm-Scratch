# Decision-Tree-Algorithm-Scratch
Decision tree algorithm implemented from scratch using restaurant data 
### Data
Restaurant data used to train the decision tree model is shown in the image below. Dataset has 12 records, 10 attributes and a target label wait time. Task is to build a decison tree algorithm to train a model on this data to predict the wait time based on 10 attributes. Data can be downloaded from https://github.com/aimacode/aima-data/blob/master/restaurant.csv
